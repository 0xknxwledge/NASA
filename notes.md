## Space Apps Data Notes
- catalog tells which events happen when in the data
    - includes name of file, absolute & relative time, etc.
    - we do NOT need to predict type of moonquake
    - ** IMPORTANT **: Be sure to include whether we use abs or rel time in header

### Lunar Data
- Passive seismic experiments were deployed with Apollo 11 (1969), Apollo 12 (1969), Apollo 14 (1971), Apollo 15 (1971) and Apollo 16 (1972) [10]. Apollo 11 returned seismic data for around twenty days. The remaining stations operated nearly continuously from their installation until September 1977
